# Brain-Tumor-MRI
ðŸ§  Brain Tumor MRI Classification

This project is a deep learning-based pipeline for classifying brain MRI scans into different categories of tumors (glioma, meningioma, pituitary) and non-tumor.
It uses DenseNet121 (transfer learning with ImageNet weights) and custom preprocessing techniques to achieve robust performance.

ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ… Preprocessing (resizing, normalization, noise reduction, sharpening)

âœ… Data Augmentation for improving generalization

âœ… DenseNet121 as backbone (transfer learning)

âœ… Early stopping to prevent overfitting

âœ… Training & evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
